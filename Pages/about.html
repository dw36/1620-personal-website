    <p>  
        My Chinese name is Tsz Hin Wu. You can call me <em>David</em> instead. Actually, I wanted 
        to come to Canada when I was teenager because one of my best friends 
         went to Toronto at that time. I finally came here in 2018.</p>

    <p> I worked for a construction materials company in Hong Kong before I came to Vancouver. Now   I am still working
         part- time for the company doing some paper work online.</p>

    <p> In my personal life, I have a lot of hobbies. My top three hobbies are music, 
        movies, and cars. I love playing guitar so much! Any spare time I have, 
        I will play it right away. I also enjoy watching movies, especially science 
        fiction movies and historical ones because they inspire me and make me more 
        knowledgeable.</p>

    <p> I am also a big fan of car racing. Such as <strong>F1, GT or Rally</strong> .</p>

    <p> Unfortunately, I don’t have enough time to pursue all my interests and hobbies, but that keeps me motivated to work to create free time for them.</p>
    <p>It is a great honor to have the opportunity to study with great people like you all; let’s help each other and improve together in the coming two years.
